# optimize-fs-peptide
Investigating best way to optimize fs-peptide data for the 'Model Selection' chapter of my Thesis.

There were two repos purpoting to be hyperparamopt

1. A large one on my Google Drive 
2. A smaller one tarred on Google Drive

(2) had more fs-peptide stuff including relevant commits. 

(1) got cleaned of extraneous files and pushed to github. I then pulled these 
changes onto (2). 

(2) is this repo. (1) is archived locally.
